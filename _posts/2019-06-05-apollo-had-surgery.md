So dad informed me today that our family doggo has had to have colon surgery.<br/> Silly pupper is 10 going on 11 years old and has just decided to start stealing out of the kitchen bin at night.<br/>
Only a couple of months ago he was at the vets having a rotten tooth removed, then after a night of ‘weakness’ having to pass tin foil and sharp spare rib bones he’d eaten, but this time it's wooden kebab skewers and surgery. He had to have scans and every inch of his intestines felt to make sure they’d cut out everything he’s ingested. <br/> 
<br/>
Damn pets, getting so stubborn as they age. Our family boyo is a staffy-mutt; a more accurate description without a photo, would be to visualise if you glued some ears to a small seal,and instead of it looking like a staff, maybe glued some tiny greyhound legs onto a staffy torso.<br/>
<br/>
My dad and Apollo might as well be attached at the hip, so I can’t imagine what he must be feeling right now. Wherever my dad is, Apollo is either within reaching distance, or on him; he's a bit like a slightly crappy weighted blanket that smells like feet. <br/>
I know how much he means to dad so I won't pressure him for updates while he heals, but here's to hoping he pulls through alright. <br/> 
<br/>
Dealing with the loss of a pet is something I’d never wish on anyone. I know particularly with people on the spectrum and who are very bonded with their fur-buddies, they’ve been there when know one else has, seen the tears and heartbreaks, and kept us living. <br/>
<br/>
It’s never been the same since I lost my boy Ginger. I’d like to do a longer post or YT video on pets and Aspergers one day, and also addressing the trauma of pet loss, when I have the strength to address it. He lived to about 17 and I’d known him all my life since I was 6 years old. <br/> I’m lucky to be a cat-mamma again to two kitty siblings, and I love them dearly, but as anyone who has lost knows, new life is never a replacement and grief is a very long and complicated process.
