So I wrapped up this week earlier on, on a wednesday evening after having had no sleep for 40+ hrs. <br/>
I managed to survive a 2 day workshop followed by the pub on day one, then a very lively work party straight afterwards on day two…  It’s also been 20ish degrees (celcius) all week, so I am so incredibly low on energy, but I must say (and enthusiastically!) that it’s been great, honest. <br/>
I may have ruined a Spice Girls song in group karaoke with members of the youth board I’m on, but I think the IDGAF confidence to do that comes with lack of sleep haha. <br/>
<br/>
For once I am appreciating this first bout of heavy sunshine in a while, and feeling like this year will be a pivotal one in terms of change and growth. Peace and love to you all. x
