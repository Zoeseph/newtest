Today I attended an AI workshop for Womxn, followed by a Musical Coding workshop using SuperCollider. ‘Programming Music’ a fairly new concept to me, but I have instantly found such appreciation and fascination for code-driven music and those in the craft and algorave community. <br/>
It was also great to learn a bit about Diagflow and “rewrite the system” with fellow womxn, hacking an AI system to be more rebellious against misogyny and patriarchal oppression.<br/>
<br/>
Overall it was a brilliant and pleasant way to spend my Saturday, versus cooped up indoors.<br/>
<br/>
I’m trying to get better at “integration” and am finding that through the gallery I Intern at, my confidence and social skills are getting better and easier to exercise. As it was Pride Day, I of course donned my beautiful thrifted designer rainbow shirt, and the Brum Pride celebrations could be heard outside throughout most of the afternoon, so there was a lovely & merry atmosphere throughout the day.
