I spent the last couple days taking part in a workshop all about the tech and creative choices within theatre piece ‘[A Moment of Madness][1]’.<br/>
Described as “immersive theatre meets urban gaming in this political espionage thriller”,
It was a fascinating and eye opening introduction into the world of immersive theatre, run by the mastermind creators’ [Katie Day][2] and [John Sear][3].<br/>
I had no idea that tech has started to emerge so much within the arts & theatre world, and is being used so artistically and innovatively. I was reminded that there are of course walking tours, and as part of our group challenge, we wrote a beautiful narrative for a local church, to listen to whilst completing a puzzle, and looking for clues. I’ve never thought of escape rooms as artsy (mainly due to having not participated in one before - out of sight, out of mind), but as a now and then gamer, and appreciating games like “don't talk nobody explode” and maybe wanting to explore designing a virtual Escape room in the Future, I have been utterly blown away by the tech, ideas, and thoughts presented. Thank you so much [John][3] and [Katie][2], for a wonderful day and unforgettable experience! AMOM is incredibly unique in truly being ‘immersive’ as the audience become true participants in what is a live experience as well as a performance... Definitely check out more on the website as they’re touring this year! 

I can honestly say (since I am also reviewing this post several months later) it has entirely changed my perspective, and the way I think about ideas and problems, and how limitless the marriage between Tech and Art is. <br/>
Another take-away is that I am so excited to see VR blow up; it’s still not a common household thing, but is very up and coming in many art galleries currently.  I can’t wait to witness, and maybe be a part of trying to harness the full current potential of VR in public spaces. I’ve actually started work on my own VR Experience as part of my Internship (hopefully more on that soon)! Meanwhile, I will bask in this lovely & nice feeling of being in the right place at the right time for many things this year. May it be great for creativity, exploration (of oneself, as well as literal exploration) and just generally continue to be a good 2019.
