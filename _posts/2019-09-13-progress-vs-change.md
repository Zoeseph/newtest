Yesterday was the galleries preview evening, so I've spent some time this morning to both nap, rehydrate and re energise. Naturally Napkin threw up at 9am in three different places and had me up and about cleaning and spot checking, but back to my fridge; I'm aware that I'm staring at my printed calendar sheet for October 2018,and above it, the one for September but it doesn't hit me that I stuck that up over a year ago.
I’ve come such a long way in the last year in terms of self growth, mental health, and career progression. It may not be externally obvious, but mentally, 2018 feels so alien and long ago.

In terms of progression VS changing as a person; that’s a challenging one. Progression is deemed positive, whereas change can be good or bad. I mean the fact that I still have a calendar up from a year ago, can give a lot of insight into other areas and aspects of my life, speaking volumes on aspects of myself that I still struggle with, and have not, or will never quite master. On the other hand though, 2017 and before, you’d have never spotted a calendar or any form of organisational aid within my home, because aside from the odd appointment, I stayed indoors and my mental health was a mess.

The first steps are always the hardest, but be the change you want to see. I heard of the Pareto Principle the other day, and it logically sums up well the point I make; it suggests that 20 percent of ones activities will account for 80 percent of your results. So as an example, weight loss and the gym; if getting to the gym accounts for 20%, then aim for just that 20%, then once you’re there it’s up to you what you work on or how hard you work, as if you hadn’t achieved that 20% you’d still be at home at 0%, but once there will have the option of following through.

I had not realised that there was an actual principle for this, but similarly, my 20% back in 2018 was signing up for things and giving myself a reason to properly get out of the house. From there, I could learn to understand my social anxieties in more depth, but also have conversations that I would have otherwise missed out on, leading to opportunities that I would have otherwise not known existed. 

As much as I’m grateful for those opportunities, I owe a lot to my adopted bravery (because of course it doesn’t come naturally), daring to take leaps where I could or have indeed been hurt or knocked down, and trying my best to keep my goals and ambitions in mind. It’s hard work to do that when mentally unwell, but that’s when you know that you are earning your days off when you need a good me-day and self care, as opposed to having an abundance of them and in turn  enslaving yourself to your mental illness; letting it win.

You got this my lovelies!
