I saw a piece of artwork this morning and it got my sleep deprived, overactive brain thinking about how different our taste is of what we consume versus what we create, and how beautiful a thing it is that one can truly express themself through an abstract and unique form, yet no matter what box it ticks the most, we have all of these other favourite boxes that we love to peek inside. We don't add to these boxes but we adore and appreciate them and the diversity within the broader art form that we love. <br/>
I love the idea that some of these boxes are so worn and yet so adored that they're practically falling apart, yet full to the brim and spreading out to nearby boxes, forming clusters in pools. <br/>
<br/>
Just a long winded metaphorical visualisation of how relationships and influences of alike work can form genres and categories.. but then that poses the dilemma of how does one truly start to fill their own box, if there's already a million other boxes, and the rule still dictates that it has to start with a box because outwardly, everything looks exactly the same. <br/>
<br/>
Can you tell Iâ€™ve had trouble sleeping lately and am a bit sleep deprived? My Mind has been endlessly restless; there goes my productive day whilst I daydream deeply about boxes apparently, haha!
