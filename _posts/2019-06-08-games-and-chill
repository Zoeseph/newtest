I’ve really been struggling to switch my brain off lately, I forced myself to take a much needed a day in order to try to switch off. <br/>
I played GRIS in the morning, which is a beautiful game; a sidescroller hand painted in watercolour style, with a mesmerising and gentle soundtrack who’s melody  accompanies the soft artistic style and befit the grace of the main heroine perfectly, you play as a character who seems to have lost her powers, fallen to the earth bellow, and explore numerous lands. <br/> 

Later on in the afternoon/evening, I dusted off the PS3 to play Dead Rising 2 and recalled fond memories of playing with brother, several years ago. <br/>
<br/>
As much as I appreciate PC’s for their multifunctionality, I can understand that in terms of gaming, they’re not as accessible for replacing console gaming for everyone. <br/> 
When it comes to PC gaming, you want to be able to understand your hardware, and graphics cards, which respectfully can be overwhelming to many people not working within IT or having studied Computer Science at some level… That, and nothing beats lounging on the couch comfortably with a controller VS sat at a desk! <br/>
For those that have experienced 60fps for games though, It’s definitely hard to go back to most consoles maxing at 30fps, after the flexibility of pc gaming. <br/>
<br/> 
Maybe one day I’ll upload some of my awkward *Let’s Plays* that I recorded maybe a year or two back now, and pick it up again haha.
