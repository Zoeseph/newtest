I did some tech support today for the Gallery. Seems that the VR headset was overheating. It was nice to tap back into my tech support roots though and conduct some troubleshooting. I’ve worked for mostly professional clientele, so it was refreshing to be customer/public facing. People are a lot more understanding, polite and friendly. <br/> 
My aim for current and future projects I’m working on, is to create **free** (if it’s somehow sustainable) experiences for the general public, so after today, I’m definitely looking forward to spending some time getting into some of art/tech projects I’ve planned.
