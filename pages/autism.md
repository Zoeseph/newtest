a little intro para here or two. info about my autism, late diagnosis at 25, personal experiences and wanting to help others. this page is to collate and share information and resources which have been useful to me, and that I believe will be helpful to others too. <br/>Probably worth having a lil mini paragraph for each lil subject section.

## stim toys and coping mechanisms 

* link 1
* link 2
* link 3
* link 4
* *Chef's Special* - Selected by Zo (lil para on what is is, why it helped me, why it'd recommend)<br> lots to mention here in particular subtle stim toys - not all have to look like or be marketed stim toys, for them to be excellent outlets;
* diamond pen (eg) <br/> fantastic for suttle twisting, nice and weighty to hold and twirl/flick about, shiny to look at, and diamond is pretty when it catches the light. 
* bike fidget <br/> very rhobust, great for when stressed, toy but doesnt look like a *toy*, can be clipped onto keys, or other things as it is made of keyring parts. 
* also headphones, *the beanie*, list some of the others.


## co morbidities - (links relevant to adhd/add, ocd, ibs, executive dysfunction)

* link 1

* link 3
* link 4
* *Chef's Special* - Selected by Zo (lil para on what is is, why it helped me, why it'd recommend) <br/> mention IBS, mass-making sandwiches, and back up ready meals/frozen meals because of executive dysfunction. a section on routines? -  sleep hygienee being important, making notes to stop mind wondering or to park intrusive thoughts, and shake up having one fixation, and managing your hobbies and projects by having a time table/ different days for different stuff, strict lunchtime routine of no work and specific tasks i find work better in the morning, and better in the afternoon or evening depending on factors like noise at times of day, ambience/lighting, hungriness.
