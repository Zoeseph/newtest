## I am inspired by...

Me - and that's an okay thing to say! it's taken a long time to come to that conclusion, but I've come far and am fair in recognising the journey I've taken, my obstacles, fears and feats. I've come further than I expected, and am still aspiring to reach heights that I dream of. Inspiring yourself is something magical when you discover who you are, and the love, respect and admiration that you have for yourself. Be fair in your critique, but also be fair in recognising your talents, ambitions and aspirations!

I've also been heavily inspired by some amazing women and people within the Arts industry ,and across other communities, whom have graced me with some pivotal and thought provoking topics and conversations. Listening to other people's passions, hobbies and practices, and the differing journey’s and depths to getting to where they are, I have such a pure and genuine appreciation for. Achieving your dreams and having aspirations that you can say are now present, existing and achieved;  those are the adventures that we all yearn to walk and run towards, but many cannot or will not take that first step. 



## Bonus wholesome Bob Ross Quotes to feed the soul

You create the dream - then you bring it into your world. Let the paint work. Just let your mind wander and enjoy. This should make you happy. I was blessed with a very steady hand; and it comes in very handy when you're doing these little delicate things. Anyone can paint. 

If it's not what you want - stop and change it. Don't just keep going and expect it will get better. You have freedom here. The only guide is your heart. Put your feelings into it, your heart, it's your world. 

"They say everything looks better with odd numbers of things. But sometimes I put even numbers—just to upset the critics. It all happens automatically. Let's have a nice tree right here. This is truly an almighty mountain. We spend so much of our life looking - but never *seeing.* "

– Bob Ross.
